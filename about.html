        <h1>Research career visualization</h1>
        <p>
            The visualization that we propose is a nonlinear ordered
            representation that allows to follow the publications of an author.
            It also allows you to see the topics an author has
            addressed by displaying the most frequent keywords of its papers.
        </p>
        <div class="content">
            <img style="width: 15%; height: auto;" src="circle.png"/>
            <p style="margin-left: 95px;">
                The circles represent the papers, they are accompanied by the
                year of publication and their size is proportional to the number
                of citations. Hovering the circle displays more information like
                the title and the number of citations. It also highlight the
                co-authors and keywords of the paper.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content margin-top">
            <img style="width: 15%; height: auto;" src="co-author.png"/>
            <p style="margin-left: 94px;">
                The squares represent the co-authors and are related to the
                papers in which they participated. Hovering the square
                displays more information like the name of the co-author and the
                cumulative citations count of the co-author. It also highlight
                papers in which they participated.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content margin-top">
            <img style="width: 15%; height: auto;" src="keywords.png"/>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                The keywords are at most twenty. These are the most recurrent
                keywords in an author's work. They are extracted from the
                paper's keywords title and abstract.
